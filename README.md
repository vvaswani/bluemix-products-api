# Products REST API

This is a REST API to create and manage a simple products database. It is intended to serve as a template for a more complex REST API. It's built with the BulletPHP micro-framework and Eloquent ORM and requires PHP and MySQL.

## Getting Started

* Download the code from [JazzHub](https://hub.jazz.net/project/vvaswani/products-api). 
* Follow the directions in [this IBM developerWorks article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-deployrest-app/index.html) to download, install and configure the necessary dependencies. 
* You can then deploy the API either to your local PHP/MySQL environment or to BlueMix.

## Demo
* Use Swagger to explore [the demo version of the API](http://products-api.ng.bluemix.net/api-docs/swagger-ui/#!/products).
